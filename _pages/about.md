Moin! I am a second-year PhD in the <a href= "https://www.uni-bremen.de/dynamical-systems"> Dynamics Group </a> at the University of Bremen (Germany), under the supervision of<a href= "https://user.math.uni-bremen.de/apohl/"> Prof. Dr. Anke Pohl</a>. I am interested in the interdisplinary field of Ergodic Theory and Machine Learning. Currently, my main research topics are applications of Koopman operator, kernel methods, and error analysis. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 2019 and worked as a software developer in Singapore.
